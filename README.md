# Hello-world
This is first wel come program in java language.
The println("...") method prints the string "..." and moves the cursor to a new line.
The print("...") method instead prints just the string "...", but does not move the cursor to a new line. 
Hence, subsequent printing instructions will print on the same line.
The println() method can also be used without parameters, to position the cursor on the next line
